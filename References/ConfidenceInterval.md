Confidence Interval Statisticians use a confidence interval to express the degree of uncertainty associated with a sample statistic. A confidence interval is an interval estimate combined with a probability statement.

For example, suppose a statistician conducted a survey and computed an interval estimate, based on survey data. The statistician might use a confidence level to describe uncertainty associated with the interval estimate. He/she might describe the interval estimate as a "95% confidence interval". This means that if we used the same sampling method to select different samples and computed an interval estimate for each sample, we would expect the true population parameter to fall within the interval estimates 95% of the time.

The Confidence Interval formula is

X ± Z (s/√(n))

Where:  
    X is the mean  
    Z is the Z-value from the table below  
    s is the standard deviation  
    n is the number of observations  
    
Z  
90% 1.645

95% 1.960

99% 2.576

99.5% 2.807

99.9% 3.291
