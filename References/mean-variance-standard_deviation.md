# Mean

## What is Mean?
Mean is the sum of a list of a number divided by the amount of number.

## How to find mean
1. Add up all data values to get the sum
2. Count the number of values in your data set
3. Divide the sum by the count

## Formula
mean = x = (∑ xi) / n

### Example 
If you have list of runs made by cricketer in 5 games is : 65,37,45,93,130
then mean of runs is : 65 + 37 + 45 + 93 + 130 / 5 = 74 Runs

# Variance

Variance is calculated by taking the differences between each number in the data set and the mean, then squaring the differences to make them positive, and finally dividing the sum of the squares by the number of values in the data set.

sample variance = s2 = ∑(xi-x)2 / n - 1
    where,
    xi = value of data set
    x = mean value of all data set
    n = total number of data set
    
### Example 
If we take the same example like mean then,

sample variance = (65-74)2 + (37-74)2 + (45-74)2 + (93-74)2 + (130-74)2 / 4  
                = 81 + 1369 + 841 + 361 + 56 / 4    
                = 2704 / 4
                = 677
                
# Standard Deviation
Standard Deviation = s = SQRT(sample variance)

### Example 
If we take the same example then,

Standard deviation = sqrt(677)  
                   = 26.01
