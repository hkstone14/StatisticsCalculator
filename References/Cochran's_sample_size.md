The Cochran formula allows you to calculate an ideal sample size given a desired level of precision, desired confidence level, and the estimated proportion of the attribute present in the population.

Cochran’s formula is considered especially appropriate in situations with large populations. A sample of any given size provides more information about a smaller population than a larger one, so there’s a ‘correction’ through which the number given by Cochran’s formula can be reduced if the whole population is relatively small.

The Cochran formula is:

n0 = (Z**2)p*q / e**2


Where:

e is the desired level of precision (i.e. the margin of error),
p is the (estimated) proportion of the population which has the attribute in question,
q is 1 – p.


Steps for sample size (Cochran's formulas):

I. Cochran's sample size formula for categorical data for an alpha level a priori at .05 (error of 5%) = n0=(t)2*(p)(q)/(d)2=384

Where: n0 is the sample size, t is the value for the selected alpha level, e.g. 1.96 for (0.25 in each tail) a 95 percent confidence level. p is the estimated proportion of an attribute that is present in the population. q is 1-p. (p)(q) are the estimate of variance. d is the acceptable margin of error for proportion being estimated, so the confidence interval, in decimals.

II. Cochran’s correction formula, when pop. <50.000 is: n1 = 384/(1+384/528)= 222

Where: population size =528 Where n0 = required return sample size according to Cochran’s formula= 384 Where n1 = required return sample size because sample > 5% of population
