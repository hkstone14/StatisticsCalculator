# Simple random sampling

## What is Simple random sampling?
A simple random sample is often mentioned in elementary statistics classes, but it’s actually one of the least used techniques. In theory, it’s easy to understand. However, in practice it’s tough to perform. 

Technically, a simple random sample is a set of n objects in a population of N objects where all possible samples are equally likely to happen. Here’s a basic example of how to get a simple random sample: put 100 numbered bingo balls into a bowl (this is the population N). Select 10 balls from the bowl without looking (this is your sample n). Note that it’s important not to look as you could (unknowingly) bias the sample. While the “lottery bowl” method can work fine for smaller populations, in reality you’ll be dealing with much larger populations. 

## When to use?
Simple random sampling is a method used to cull a smaller sample size from a larger population and use it to research and make generalizations about the larger group. ... The advantages of a simple random sample include its ease of use and its accurate representation of the larger population.

##How to calculate the Simple random sampling?
Simple random sampling of a sample “n” of 3 from a population “N” of 12.  

Place the 12 game pieces in a bowl and (again, without looking) choose 3. This is simple random sampling.
