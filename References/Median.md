# Median

## What is Median?
A median is a value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population or a probability distribution. For a data set, it may be thought of as "the middle" value. 

##Why median important? 
The basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the "average") is that it is not skewed so much by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a "typical" value.

For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets, which vary greatly, the mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values. Median income, for example, may be a better way to suggest what a "typical" income is. Because of this, the median is of central importance in robust statistics, as it is the most resistant statistic, having a breakdown point of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the median will not give an arbitrarily large or small result. 
## How do you calculate the median? 
The median of a finite list of numbers is the "middle" number, when those numbers are listed in order from smallest to greatest. 

Formally, a median of a population is any value such that at most half of the population is less than the proposed median and at most half is greater than the proposed median. As seen above, medians may not be unique. If each set contains less than half the population, then some of the population is exactly equal to the unique median.  

## Formula
Median= (n/2)th when n is odd

Median = (n+1/2)th when n is even 

where n is number of element

“th” just means the (n)th number. 

## Example
102, 56, 34, 99, 89, 101, 10, 54.

Step 1: Place the data in ascending order (smallest to highest).
10, 34, 54, 56, 89, 99, 101, 102.

Step 2: Find the TWO numbers in the middle (where there are an equal number of data points above and below the two middle numbers).
10, 34, 54, 56, 89, 99, 101, 102

Step 3: Add the two middle numbers and then divide by two, to get the average:

56 + 89 = 145
145 / 2 = 72.5.
The median is 72.5.
