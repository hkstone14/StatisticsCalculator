# Margin of error

## What is Margin of error?
A margin of error tells you how many percentage points your results will differ from the real population value. For example, a 95% confidence interval with a 4 percent margin of error means that your statistic will be within 4 percentage points of the real population value 95% of the time.

More technically, the margin of error is the range of values below and above the sample statistic in a confidence interval. The confidence interval is a way to show what the uncertainty is with a certain statistic (i.e. from a poll or survey).   

##Why margin of error important? 
The margin of error is an extremely important concept in statistics. This is because it is difficult to study the entire population and the sampling is not free from sampling errors.

The margin of error is a statistic expressing the amount of random sampling error in the results of a survey. The larger the margin of error, the less confidence one should have that a poll result would reflect the result of a survey of the entire population.

For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets, which vary greatly, the mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values. Median income, for example, may be a better way to suggest what a "typical" income is. Because of this, the median is of central importance in robust statistics, as it is the most resistant statistic, having a breakdown point of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the median will not give an arbitrarily large or small result. 
## How do you calculate the margin of error? 
The margin of error can be calculated in two ways, depending on whether you have parameters from a population or statistics from a sample: Margin of error = Critical value x Standard deviation for the population. Margin of error = Critical value x Standard error of the sample.
## Formula
MOE = Z * squareroot of( (standard deviation)*(standard deviation)/n)

where....

MOE = Margin of errpr

Z = quantile 

n = sample size

## Example
A poll might state that there is a 98% confidence interval of 4.88 and 5.26. That means if the poll is repeated using the same techniques, 98% of the time the true population parameter (parameter vs. statistic) will fall within the interval estimates (i.e. between 4.88 and 5.26) 98% of the time. 

The margin of error tells you the range of values above and below a confidence interval. 

A poll might report that a certain candidate is going to win an election with 51 percent of the vote; The confidence level is 95 percent and the error is 4 percent. Let’s say the poll was repeated using the same techniques. The pollsters would expect the results to be within 4 percent of the stated result (51 percent) 95 percent of the time. In other words, 95 percent of the time they would expect the results to be between: 

51 – 4 = 47 percent and 

51 + 4 = 55 percent. 

The margin of error can be calculated in two ways, depending on whether you have parameters from a population or statistics from a sample: 

Margin of error = Critical value x Standard deviation for the population. 

Margin of error = Critical value x Standard error of the sample.
