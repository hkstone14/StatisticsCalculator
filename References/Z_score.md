# Z-Score

## What is z-score?
A z-score describes the position of a raw score in terms of its distance from the mean, when measured in standard deviation units. The z-score is positive if the value lies above the mean, and negative if it lies below the mean.

It is also known as a standard score, because it allows comparison of scores on different kinds of variables by standardizing the distribution. A standard normal distribution (SND) is a normally shaped distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation (SD) .

##Why are z-scores important? 
It is useful to standardize the values (raw scores) of a normal distribution by converting them into z-scores because: 

(a) It allows researchers to calculate the probability of a score occurring within a standard normal distribution; 

(b) And enables us to compare two scores that are from different samples (which may have different means and standard deviations).  

## How do you calculate the z-score? 
the z-score is simply the raw score minus the population mean, divided by the population standard deviation. 

## Formula
z-score= z = (x-μ)/σ
where x is the raw score,
      μ is the population mean, 
      σ is the population standard deviation.
